In this project, I developed an end to end deep learning model to classify images of dogs and cats. I started by downloading the dogs vs cats dataset from kaggle, extracting and exploring the dataset, and selecting 1,000 cat images and 1,000 dog images to balance the classes. I resized all images to 224Ã—224 pixels, labeled them appropriately (cats = 0, dogs = 1), and converted the images into numpy arrays. I then split the dataset into training and testing sets and normalized the pixel values to scale between 0 and 1. Using tensorflow and tensorflow hub, I built a neural network by leveraging the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model as a feature extractor, followed by a dense layer for binary classification. After compiling the model with the Adam optimizer and Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss function, I trained it for 10 epochs, achieving a test accuracy of 98.25%. Finally, I built a prediction system that allows users to input any new image, processes the image, and predicts whether it represents a cat or a dog, successfully validating it with external images downloaded from google.
